## About me

I am a seasoned frontend web developer with over 15 years of industry experience.
Over the past 8 years, my professional journey has been predominantly dedicated to frontend enterprise software development within the realm of large-scale projects.
My focus centres on cultivating clean code and adhering to SOLID principles, with a strong emphasis on delivering fully tested features (unit, component and functional testing).
I like to architect clean and modular business logic applications as well as custom UI centric features without the baggage of external libraries, whenever it makes sense
My current main stack is TypeScript, React, Redux (or Zustand w/ Immer), RTL, Cypress but Iâ€™m always keen on exploring new stacks.
I am experienced at mentoring junior and mid-weight developers, helping them to develop their skills during pair programming sessions and code reviews.
I also like to be as close to the product as possible by working with POâ€™s, Analysts, QA testers, designers and scrum masters to fully understand the business requirements and deliver results that meet the criteria without compromising on code quality.
